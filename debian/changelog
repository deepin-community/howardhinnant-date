howardhinnant-date (3.0.1+ds-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: explicitly build-depend on tzdata
  * d/patches: always mark HAS_STRING_VIEW as part of the interface.
    If the library gets compiled with HAS_STRING_VIEW=1, consumers always
    need to link to the functions using std::string_view, as they are the
    only ones compiled into the shared library.
    If the library gets compiled with e.g. C++17 and the user uses an older
    standard version they'll still get an error, but an helpful compile-time
    one suggesting to enable C++17 mode, instead of a cryptic linking error.
  * d/tests: fix cmake autopkgtest on bullseye

howardhinnant-date (3.0.1+ds-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 3.0.1+ds
  * d/copyright: exclude bundled tzdata
  * d/.docs: install full documentation
  * d/gbp.conf: disable pristine-tar.
    It doesn't seem to work with MUT.
  * d/rules: make use of GCC Visibility.
    The library is now compiled with -fvisibility=hidden and
    -fvisibility-inlines-hidden, and symbols are selectively exposed in the
    shared object by making use of upstream's already existing support for
    Windows' dllexport.
  * d/watch: download documentation component

  * d/patches: drop cmake-rename patch.
    It creates more problems than it solves.
    The patch only modified the name of libraries, targets and namespaces
    in CMake, but did not touch headers. This caused problems for CMake
    users, that had to account for the "Debian name" of the library, while
    not solving name clashes where needed the most, i.e. in header files.
    The libhowardhinnant-date-dev package will keep its name, as libdate-dev
    is too general for a package name, and adding the howardhinnant prefix
    there doesn't create issues in users' code.
    As the date-tz target is no longer renamed, the shared library changed
    name from libhowardhinnant-date-tz to libdate-tz, and the binary package
    containing it did as well. (Closes: #1011640)
  * d/patches: stop using PATH_MAX.
    This will properly fix the build on GNU Hurd, while also improving the
    code on all the other platforms.
